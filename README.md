# OEP Acquisition (Engineering Acquisition Manager)

The Trust Layer of the Open Engineering Platform (OEP): engineering
acquisition, provenance, integrity, licensing, and trusted evidence. See
`oep_architecture/docs/architecture/PLATFORM_SERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md`
and this repository's own `docs/architecture/SDD-R013` through
`SDD-R019` for the full architecture.

## Status

**WORK_PACKAGE_001 (Repository Bootstrap) and WORK-PACKAGE-002
(Official Source Registry) implemented.** The Official Source Registry
is the platform's first persistent engineering domain service: a
PostgreSQL-backed CRUD service with a REST API for maintaining the
catalog of trusted engineering information sources. Browser automation,
the download engine, metadata extraction, integrity verification,
license management, and the Reference Vault remain out of scope --
see `docs/tasks/WORK_PACKAGE_001.md` and `docs/tasks/WORK-PACKAGE-002.md`.

## Build

Requires:

- CMake 3.25+
- A C++23 compiler (MSVC, or another compiler with equivalent C++23 support)
- PostgreSQL 18 development files (headers + `libpq`) -- see
  [postgresql.org/download](https://www.postgresql.org/download/); on
  Windows this ships with the standard installer
- Network access the first time you configure (CMake's `FetchContent`
  downloads spdlog, nlohmann/json, tomlplusplus, cpp-httplib, and
  Catch2 -- see "Implementation Decisions" below)

From a shell with your C++ toolchain on `PATH` (e.g. a Visual Studio
Developer Command Prompt on Windows):

```
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build
```

If CMake cannot find PostgreSQL automatically, point it at your
installation explicitly:

```
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:/Program Files/PostgreSQL/18"
```

## Run

```
build/src/app/oep_acquisition[.exe] config/config.toml
```

The config file argument is optional -- every setting has a documented
default (`include/oep/acquisition/common/config.hpp`) and the process
starts without one. On Windows, `libpq.dll` (and its own dependencies)
must be reachable on `PATH` at runtime; PostgreSQL's own `bin/`
directory already contains it:

```
set PATH=C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\18\bin;%PATH%
```

Verify it's alive:

```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
# {"status":"ok"}
```

A database connection failure is logged as a warning, never fatal --
WORK_PACKAGE_001 requires the connection object to exist and behave
correctly, not that a matching PostgreSQL instance is running wherever
the process starts. WORK-PACKAGE-002's Official Source Registry
repository follows the same non-fatal precedent: if it cannot connect
at startup, the process still starts with `GET /health` only --
`/sources` becomes available again on the next restart once the
database is reachable.

### Official Source Registry API

Once a database with the `official_sources` table (see
`migrations/V2__official_sources.sql`) is reachable:

```
GET    /sources                List sources; optional query filters:
                                status, trust_level, category, country
GET    /sources/{id}           Fetch one source by UUID
POST   /sources                Create a source (JSON body)
PUT    /sources/{id}           Replace a source (JSON body)
DELETE /sources/{id}           Soft-delete a source
```

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/sources \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"IEEE","base_url":"https://ieee.org","trust_level":5,"status":"active"}'
```

`name`, `base_url`, `trust_level` (0-5), and `status` (`proposed`,
`approved`, `active`, `suspended`, `deprecated`, `archived`) are
required; `authentication_type` (`none`, `username_password`,
`api_key`, `oauth2`, `client_certificate`) defaults to `none`. `id` and
`created_at` are assigned by the database and immutable afterward --
attempting to change either on `PUT` returns `422`.

## Test

```
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Configuration parsing, the database connection wrapper's failure path,
a real end-to-end `GET /health` request against the embedded HTTP
server (bound to an OS-assigned ephemeral port, so tests never collide
with a fixed port number or each other), and -- for the Official Source
Registry -- validation, Service-layer (against an in-memory fake
repository), Repository-layer, REST API, and migration/schema-shape
tests.

The last three categories need a real PostgreSQL database and `SKIP`
(not fail) if one isn't reachable, continuing WORK_PACKAGE_001's
precedent that the suite stays runnable without a live database, just
less exercised. To run them for real, create a role and database
matching `config/config.toml`'s defaults:

```sql
CREATE ROLE oep_acquisition LOGIN PASSWORD 'your-local-dev-password';
CREATE DATABASE oep_acquisition OWNER oep_acquisition;
```

then either edit `config/config.toml`'s `[database] password` locally
(never commit a real credential there) or point the tests at different
connection settings via environment variables, which take precedence:

```
OEP_TEST_DB_HOST, OEP_TEST_DB_PORT, OEP_TEST_DB_NAME,
OEP_TEST_DB_USER, OEP_TEST_DB_PASSWORD
```

The Repository/API/migration tests apply `migrations/V1__initial_schema.sql`
and `migrations/V2__official_sources.sql` verbatim from disk the first
time they run against a given database (so they exercise the real,
committed migration files) and `TRUNCATE` the table between test runs
-- no Flyway CLI install is required to run them, though a production
deployment should still apply migrations via Flyway (`migrations/flyway.toml`).

## Implementation Decisions

Recorded here per CLAUDE.md's "Document assumptions" default behavior
-- none of these redesign approved architecture; each fills a gap
WORK_PACKAGE_001 itself left unspecified.

**API framework: embedded C++ (`cpp-httplib`), not Node/Fastify.**
`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` lists "Primary API: Fastify" in the platform's
technology stack, but WORK_PACKAGE_001's own text asks only for a
minimal `GET /health` endpoint alongside an otherwise entirely-C++
bootstrap (CMake, spdlog, TOML, PostgreSQL, Catch2), and no
Fastify/Node code exists anywhere else in the platform yet. Introducing
an entire second language/runtime for one hardcoded JSON response,
with no binding layer to the C++ core described anywhere in this work
package, was confirmed out of scope for this work package rather than
assumed. The API framework itself has not been ratified and is
expected to be decided by a future architecture decision record; this
bootstrap uses a lightweight, header-only, in-process C++ HTTP library
so the single `/health` route has somewhere to live today.

**Database client: raw `libpq` for connection management (WORK_PACKAGE_001),
`libpqxx` for the Repository layer (WORK-PACKAGE-002).**
WORK_PACKAGE_001 asked only for "connection management. Connection
only. No schema. No repositories," so `DatabaseConnection`
(`src/database/database_connection.cpp`) stayed a small RAII wrapper
directly over the raw C API. WORK-PACKAGE-002 introduces the first real
Repository layer -- parameterized CRUD plus dynamic filtering -- which
is exactly the reassessment this file's "Future Considerations"
previously flagged; `libpqxx` (fetched via `FetchContent`, pinned to
`7.9.2`, same as every other dependency) now sits alongside raw `libpq`
so `PostgresOfficialSourceRepository` gets safe parameter binding, RAII
transactions, and typed field access instead of hand-rolled C-string
query building. `DatabaseConnection` itself is unchanged.

**`trust_level`/`status`/`authentication_type` stored as constrained
values, not native PostgreSQL `ENUM` types.** WORK-PACKAGE-002's Source
Model note ("Future fields shall not require schema redesign") is
better served by a `CHECK` constraint than a native enum: adding an
allowed value to a `CHECK` constraint is a plain, ordinary migration,
while adding a value to a PostgreSQL enum type carries additional
transactional restrictions (a newly added enum value cannot be used in
the same transaction that added it). See
`migrations/V2__official_sources.sql`.

**Externally-visible `id` is a UUID column, distinct from the
internal surrogate primary key.** WORK-PACKAGE-002's suggested column
list includes both `id` and `uuid`; this repository treats the
`BIGSERIAL id` as an internal-only storage key (never returned by the
API) and the `UUID` column as the identifier used throughout the REST
API and JSON bodies (`"id"` in a response is this UUID, not the
internal row number) -- both because REST resources are conventionally
addressed by a natural/opaque key rather than a sequential row number,
and because a sequential id would leak the row-insertion order and
approximate total row count to any API client.

**Dependency management: CMake `FetchContent`, not vcpkg/Conan.** No
package manager was already set up in this environment or evidenced
elsewhere in the platform. `FetchContent` is built into CMake itself,
needs no additional tool install, and pins every dependency to an
explicit tagged version (never a floating branch) for reproducible
builds.

## TODOs

- WORK_PACKAGE_003 onward: Browser, Acquisition (download engine),
  Integrity, Licensing, Reference Vault, Metadata Extraction -- per
  `docs/architecture/SDD-R013` through `SDD-R019`.
- `migrations/flyway.toml` is still not invoked by any automated
  process (see Future Considerations below).

## Future Considerations

- `migrations/flyway.toml` is not yet invoked by any automated process
  -- a future work package should wire `flyway migrate` into the build
  or a deployment step. Repository/API/migration tests currently apply
  `V1__initial_schema.sql` and `V2__official_sources.sql` verbatim
  themselves (see "Test" above) as a stand-in.
- A connection pool for `PostgresOfficialSourceRepository` (currently
  one `pqxx::connection` per repository instance, held for the
  process's lifetime) should be reassessed once concurrent request
  volume makes single-connection serialization a bottleneck.
- WORK-PACKAGE-002's REST API section lists exactly five `/sources`
  routes plus `/health`, with no dedicated enable/disable endpoints,
  even though its Functional Requirements section separately lists
  "Enable Source" / "Disable Source". `OfficialSourceService::enable`/
  `disable` exist and are unit-tested, reachable today only via the
  Service layer (or, over REST, a generic `PUT` status change) -- a
  future work package should decide whether dedicated
  `POST /sources/{id}/enable` style routes are warranted.
- No pagination (`limit`/`offset`/`cursor`) is implemented for
  `GET /sources` -- WORK-PACKAGE-002's own REST API section doesn't
  ask for it, unlike `docs/specifications/ENGINEERING_ACQUISTION_API_SPECIFICATION.md`'s
  broader target-state API (versioned `/api/v1` prefix, cursor
  pagination, OAuth2/JWT authentication on every request, events). That
  document describes the Engineering Acquisition Manager's long-term
  API vision; WORK-PACKAGE-002 is a deliberately smaller Milestone-1
  slice of it (no versioned prefix, no authentication -- explicitly out
  of scope: "Authentication providers"). Implementing this work package
  to the letter of its own REST API section, rather than the broader
  specification, matches ARCHITECTURE_AMENDMENT_POLICY.md's "do not
  expand scope" guidance; reconciling the two documents (likely via a
  future ADR or an updated SDD) is recommended before a work package
  that adds authentication or versioning to this API.
- `docs/architecture/SDD-R014-OFFICIAL_SOURCE_REGISTRY.md` and
  `docs/specifications/OFFICIAL_SOURCE_SCHEMA.md` describe a richer,
  hierarchical Organization -> Endpoint -> Service model (each with its
  own identifier, type enumeration, and metadata) than WORK-PACKAGE-002's
  flat `OfficialSource` entity. WORK-PACKAGE-002's own Trust Levels and
  Source Status values match `oep_architecture`'s
  `docs/acquisition/SDD-A002-OFFICIAL_SOURCE_REGISTRY.md` closely
  (both platform-level documents), suggesting the flat model is the
  reconciled Milestone-1 design and the repository-local SDD-R014/
  OFFICIAL_SOURCE_SCHEMA.md describe a longer-term richer vision not
  yet folded into an approved work package. This implementation follows
  WORK-PACKAGE-002 (the approved, most specific instruction) as written;
  a future work package that needs to model multiple endpoints/services
  per organization will need to reconcile these documents, likely via
  an ADR or an updated SDD-R014, before extending the schema.
